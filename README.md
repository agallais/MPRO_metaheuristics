# MPRO_metaheuristics
This project is the final assignment of the Metaheuristics course of the MPRO (Master Parisien de Recherche Op√©rationnelle) the Operation Research master of ENSTA


Idea of the first heuristic :

1/propose a heuristic that will give a admissible solution
Looking in the non-covered vertices. Pick one at random. Place a captor, then try to link the captor to the origin of the graph. Stop when all vertices are covered.

2/Find a way to explore neighboroods


3/Find an appropriate meta-heuristic to explore this neighborhood
