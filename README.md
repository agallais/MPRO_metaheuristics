This project is the final assignment of the Metaheuristics course of the MPRO (Master Parisien de Recherche Op√©rationnelle) the Operation Research master of ENSTA


Idea of the first heuristic :

Looking in the non-covered vertices. Pick one at random. Place a captor, then try to link the captor to the origin of the graph
